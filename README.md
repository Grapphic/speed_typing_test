# Speed Typing Test

This is a simple web-based speed typing test application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can test their typing speed by accurately typing a provided text prompt within a specified time frame. The application calculates and displays typing speed in words per minute (WPM) along with accuracy.

## Features

- **Typing Test:** Users are prompted to type a provided text exactly as it appears.
- **Timer:** The timer starts when the user begins typing and stops when the text is matched exactly.
- **Speed Calculation:** The application calculates typing speed in words per minute (WPM) based on the time taken to complete the test and the number of words typed.
- **Accuracy:** Accuracy is calculated by comparing the typed text with the original text prompt.

## How to Use

1. Open the application in a web browser.
2. Read the provided text prompt.
3. Start typing the text into the input field.
4. The timer starts automatically once typing begins.
5. Once the typed text matches the provided text exactly, the timer stops, and the typing speed and accuracy are displayed.
